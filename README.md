# oauth-aci

An OAuth 2.0 extension for secure authentication and authorization of AI agents.

## Problem Statement

Traditional OAuth 2.0 flows face several challenges when applied to AI agents:

1. **Identity Representation**: OAuth is designed for human users or services with clear identities. AI agents may have dynamic or ephemeral identities that don't fit traditional models.

2. **User Consent**: Standard OAuth flows often require user interaction for granting consent. AI agents may operate autonomously without direct user oversight.

3. **Scope Limitations**: Traditional scopes may not adequately represent the fine-grained permissions required for AI agent operations.

4. **Token Management**: AI agents may need to handle tokens differently, considering their potential for continuous operation or distribution across systems.

5. **Delegation Chains**: In scenarios where AI agents act on behalf of users or other agents, representing and validating these delegation chains becomes complex.

## Solution

oauth-aci addresses these challenges by:

1. **Agent-Specific Identity**: Introducing an `AgentIdentity` model that captures the unique attributes of AI agents.

2. **Autonomous Flows**: Implementing OAuth flows tailored for agent-to-service authentication without user interaction.

3. **Enhanced Scopes**: Providing a flexible scope system that can represent complex, hierarchical permissions for AI agents.

4. **Adaptive Token Handling**: Offering token management utilities designed for the operational patterns of AI agents.

5. **Delegation Representation**: Incorporating mechanisms to represent and validate multi-step delegation from users to agents to services.

## Features

- Agent-specific OAuth 2.0 flows
- Secure agent identity management
- Fine-grained scope control for AI operations
- Delegation chain support
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Easy integration with existing OAuth 2.0 providers

## Installation

Install oauth-aci using pip:
bash
pip install oauth-aci

## Quick Start

Here's a simple example of how to use oauth-aci:
python
from oauth_aci import AgentIdentity, AgentAuthorizationCodeFlow
Create an agent identity
agent = AgentIdentity(user_id="user123", name="MyAgent")
Initialize the OAuth flow
flow = AgentAuthorizationCodeFlow(client_id="your_client_id", client_secret="your_client_secret")
Perform authentication
token = flow.fetch_token(agent)
